Applet deletion (ADELG) The ADELG contains the security requirements for erasing in- stalled applets from the card, a feature introduced in Java Card specification version 2.2. Remote Method Invocation The RMIG contains the security requirements for the remote (RMIG) method invocation feature, which provides a new protocol of com- munication between the terminal and the applets. This was intro- duced in Java Card specification version 2.2. Object deletion (ODELG) The ODELG contains the security requirements for the object deletion capability. This provides a safe memory recovering mechanism. This is a Java Card specification version 2.2 fea- ture. Secure carrier (CarG) The CarG group contains minimal requirements for secure down- loading of applications on the card. This group contains the se- curity requirements for preventing, in those configurations that do not support on-card static or dynamic bytecode verification, the installation of a package that has not been bytecode verified, or that has been modified after bytecode verification.
